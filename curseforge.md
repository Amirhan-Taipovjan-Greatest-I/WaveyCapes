# WaveyCapes

Now that every player in the game gets a vanilla cape, why not at least make capes looking good. This mod splits the cape into smaller parts and animates it in a more fluent way.

Since this mod is purely visual and fully clientside, so it doesn't have to be installed on servers and works everywhere!

## Dependencies

- none

## Incompatible

- Nothing known

## Tested with

- First person mod
- Not enough animations
- Sodium
- Iris
- Optifine(also the capes)
