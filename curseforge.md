# WaveyCapes

Now that every player in the game gets a vanilla cape, why not at least make capes looking good. This mod splits the cape into smaller parts and animates it in a more fluent way.

**1.1.1 update**: Capes now come with physics and getting rendered in one bent part instead of small cubes! In the config screen accessible via the mod-list(requires Mod Menu on fabric) you can change between rendering styles, cape behavior and wind effects. Note that this is still an early version of this effect, Cape Style Blocky + Cape Movement Simulation Classic will result in the same look as older versions of the mod.

Since this mod is purely visual and fully clientside, so it doesn't have to be installed on servers and works everywhere!
